        "# Homework 6: N-Gram Language Models with the Brown Corpus\n",
        "\n",
        "## Due: Midnight on October 12th @ Midnight (with 2-hour grace period) and worth 85 points.\n",
        "\n",
        "## As announced, I'll not start to count late days until midnight on 10/13 (with same grace period).\n",
        "\n",
        "In this assignment you’ll practice **probabilistic language modeling (PLM)** by building N-Gram models that generate text. Along the way, you’ll develop the core pieces of a language model: estimating probabilities, calculating sentence likelihoods, and generating text with different strategies. The goal is to understand *how simple statistical models can produce coherent language*, and to explore refinements that make them more expressive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "* Build and compare **unigram, bigram, and trigram** language models.\n",
        "* Calculate **word and sentence probabilities** (in log-space) and use them to measure **perplexity**.\n",
        "* Implement **probability-based generation** methods, including temperature-scaled sampling.\n",
        "* Explore **beam search** as a way to generate higher-quality sentences.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The four problems (high level)\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Problem 1 — N-Gram probabilities:**\n",
        "   Build unigram, bigram, and trigram models. Compute next-word probabilities in log space to avoid numerical underflow.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Problem 2 — Sentence probability & perplexity:**\n",
        "   Define sentence probability, normalize for sentence length, and calculate perplexity as a measure of model quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Problem 3 — Controlled generation:**\n",
        "   Implement temperature-controlled sampling to vary randomness in generated sentences. Compare low vs. high temperatures.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Problem 4 — Beam search:**\n",
        "   Use perplexity to guide **beam search**, keeping track of the most likely candidate sentences at each step, and compare outputs to greedy generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end, you’ll have a working N-Gram generator capable of producing reasonable and a solid understanding of how early probabilistic approaches to NLP laid the foundation for modern deep learning methods.\n",

        "### Recommended Workflow (Must Read!)\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most important skills in machine learning is following a **disciplined workflow** when developing complex code. The basic idea is simple:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Start small:** Write and test your code using a tiny subset of your dataset.\n",
        "2. **Inspect your results:** Print out and examine intermediate outputs to verify that each step behaves as expected.\n",
        "3. **Iterate and tune:** Adjust hyperparameters and continue testing, gradually increasing the subset size as needed.\n",
        "4. **Scale up:** Once you are confident your code is bug-free and your hyperparameters are roughly correct, run it on the **full dataset** to obtain your final results.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you don’t have sufficient computing resources for a full run, use **as large a subset as practical** — provided you’ve begun early enough to allow for multiple iterations.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To help you follow this workflow in this homework, I’ve included a variable `num_sentences` that controls how many sentences are used from the shuffled Brown Corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "I recommend the following progression:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Step 1:** Begin with `num_sentences = 10` to debug and print out intermediate data structures (such as dictionaries) to confirm that your code works as expected.\n",
        "* **Step 2:** Increase to `num_sentences = 100` to verify correctness and complete most of the homework efficiently.\n",
        "* **Step 3:** Finally, if possible, run with the full dataset (`num_sentences = 57_340`), or as large a subset as your resources allow, to answer the graded questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are 9 problems in this homework, each worth 9 points each, and you get 4 points free if you otherwise complete the homework."

It was the **first electronic, balanced corpus of English** ever created and contains about **one million words** drawn from **500 written texts** published in the United States in 1961.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the time, this was groundbreaking: instead of studying isolated examples, linguists and computer scientists could analyze the **statistical properties of language** across many genres. The Brown Corpus became a **benchmark dataset** in early computational linguistics, psycholinguistics, and later in natural language processing.\n",

        "* **Press**: reportage, editorials, reviews\n",
        "* **General prose**: popular lore, belles lettres, essays\n",
        "* **Fiction**: adventure, romance, science fiction, mystery, humor\n",
        "* **Learned writing**: academic and scientific publications\n",
        "* **Religious writing**: sermons, expository texts\n",
        "* **Skills and hobbies**: manuals, do-it-yourself, gardening, sports writing\n",
        "* **Government documents**: official reports, public affairs writing\n",
        "* **Miscellaneous**: popularized non-fiction, biography\n",
        "\n",
        "Each category contributes about 2,000 sentences (roughly 80,000 words), ensuring a **balanced sample** of contemporary written English.\n",

        "### Examples of Source Texts\n",
        "\n",
        "While the Brown Corpus does not preserve full books in sequence, the selections were drawn from published works of the time. Examples include:\n",

        "* **Press**: articles from major U.S. newspapers and magazines such as *Time* and *Newsweek*.\n",
        "* **Religion**: sermons, Bible commentary, religious essays.\n",
        "* **Academic**: journal articles in history, sociology, psychology, and linguistics.\n",
        "* **Skills and hobbies**: popular magazines like *Popular Mechanics* and *Field & Stream*.\n",
        "\n",
        "The corpus thus reflects a **snapshot of American English in 1961**: how it was written in popular culture, journalism, science, religion, and government.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Historical importance**: the first large corpus, setting the stage for all later corpus linguistics.\n",
        "* **Balanced design**: unlike modern web scrapes (e.g., Wikipedia), Brown was carefully curated to capture a **cross-section of genres**.\n",

        "2. **Corpus-level calculations.** Perplexity is often computed over *all tokens* in the corpus. With Brown’s ~1M tokens, multiplying raw probabilities is completely impossible.\n",
        "3. **Consistency with NLP practice.** Modern language models (n-gram and neural alike) always work in log-space. Teaching it here ensures the method scales to larger datasets like Shakespeare, WikiText, or web-scale corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The log-space trick\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall how computing in log-space works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Convert your numbers to logs\n",
        "- Instead of multiplying, add  \n",
        "- Instead of exponentiation, multiply\n",
        "- If you need to sort, or compare using $\\lt$ or $\\le$, just do it in log-space (since it is monotonic, i.e., preserves order)\n",
        "- Convert back to normal if you want to print it out in human-readable form as a metric or use it with code that expects normal probabilities (e.g., softmax, or sampling).\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This prevents underflow, keeps values in a manageable numeric range, and makes computation easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Ranking:** For decoding or beam search, you can use log-probabilities directly, since $\\log$ is monotonic. No conversion back is needed.\n",

        "✅ **TL;DR Summary:** In the Brown Corpus, you *might* get away with raw probabilities for single sentences, but log-space is essential once you apply smoothing, compute perplexity over the whole corpus, or move to larger datasets. It’s also the standard method in NLP, so it’s best to learn it now.\n",
